# ARK-Brutforce 
Bruteforces Pincodes in ARK

needs Python to work and Three Python libraries:

1. pynput
2. keyboard
3. time

i used Visual Studiyo code to run this, but maybe it also works with other Programms.

After starting the Programm you have 10 Sekunds to switch back to your window with ARK then it starts working,
while its working you can Stop it by pressing "ÃŸ",
after beeing stopt you need to start this Programm again if you wanna use it again

Before using this programm make shure that its allowed in te AGBs and the law in your country and the Servers rules and stuff like that
